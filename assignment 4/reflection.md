The talk highlighted the integration of tech and agriculture, teaching me about innovation's practical impacts on social issues. For example, "Your Farm Next Door' underscored the complex nature of entrepreneurship and the value of sustainability.

As a university student, I am motivated to seek out innovative approaches in the course of my studies, understanding technology's cutting-edge potential for bringing out beneficial societal change. 

In this way, I am able to gain more knowledge on how to develop systems that are beneficial for not only the IT field but also in various different fields and aspects. Talks like this get me inspired to think out of the box and to come up with a new and different concept.
