# REFLECTION

This talk showed me how devoted I should be and the numerous skills I should gain and improve when being in the Computer Science industry.
I need to enhance my knowledge in programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. 

I must dedicate my time and energy into learning both the theory and practical aspects of system development. 
I should go beyond my current studies and take the initiative to conquer certain system development skills so that I can become a more productive system developer in the future.

Furthermore, I should keep up with the latest technology as it will affect how efficiently I will create a system at that time by using the latest technology advancements.
To be able to develop strong work habits over the following four years, I must be able to handle large projects and working in groups.
