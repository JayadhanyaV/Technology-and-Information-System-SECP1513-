#REFLECTION

The industrial visit to UTMDigital was eye-opening, bringing my theoretical understanding of technology to life in a corporate setting. Exploring their work environment showed the actual application of concepts, while discussions with employees highlighted the difficulties and significance of staying current in the digital business. Seeing collaborative efforts between high-end IT companies and business people highlighted the dynamic nature of successful tech companies.

This encounter linked the theoretical and real-world application gaps, boosting my enthusiasm for the industry. It strengthened my determination to pursue a profession in the ever-changing tech industry.
