## My goal in taking this course is to engage myself in the field of technology, constantly challenging myself and developing my troubleshooting skills. I want to learn new programming methods, as well as how the Internet operates and its security measures. Dreaming big, I want to work with major technology companies like Google, Apple, or Microsoft.

## The design thinking project pushed me to focus on the demands of the users while also strengthening my problem-solving abilities and overcoming project hurdles. These are attributes that major technology businesses value. Working with my team taught me to adjust, which will be useful in future group tasks.

## To optimize my potential, I aim to develop projects that explore new concepts, actively participate in networking events, seek internships for hands-on experience, and stay updated on technological advancements. It is also essential for me to mentally prepare for hardship with optimism. This effort underlines my commitment to growth in the fast-paced world of technology.
