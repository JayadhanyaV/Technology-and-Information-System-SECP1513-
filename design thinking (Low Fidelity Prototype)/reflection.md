# REFLECTION

My goal in taking this course is to engage myself in the field of technology, constantly challenging myself and developing my troubleshooting skills. I want to learn new programming methods, as well as how the Internet operates and its security measures. Dreaming big, I want to work with major technology companies like Google, Apple, or Microsoft. This project is a great start to build my skills in this course.

The design thinking project pushed me to focus on the demands of the users while also strengthening my problem-solving abilities and overcoming project hurdles. These are attributes that major technology companies value. Working with my teammates has taught me to adjust, adapt and be able to make rational decisions as a team while reviewing different opinions and ideas. This is very essential for future group projects even in the working life.

To optimize my potential, I aim to develop projects that explore new concepts, actively participate in networking events, seek internships for hands-on experience, and stay updated on technological advancements. It is also essential for me to mentally prepare for hardship with optimism. This effort underlines my commitment to growth in the fast-paced world of technology.
